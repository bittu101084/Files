        "Theory questions\n",
        "-----------------\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "> A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "> The requirement for handling exceptions in Python arises when an error occurs that can cause the program to terminate. Errors interrupt the flow of the program at the point where they appear, so any further code stops executing. This error is called an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "> The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "> Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running. You can use logging to record information about errors, warnings, and other events that occur during program execution. And logging is a useful tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "> __del__ is a finalizer. It is called when an object is garbage collected which happens at some point after all references to the object have been deleted. In a simple case this could be right after you say del x or, if x is a local variable, after the function ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "> The difference between import and from import in Python is: import imports an entire code library. from import imports a specific member or members of the library.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "> Python allows you to catch multiple exceptions in a single 'except' block by specifying them as a tuple. This feature is useful when different exceptions require similar handling logic. In this case, if either 'ExceptionType1' or 'ExceptionType2' is raised, the code within the 'except' block will be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "> In Python, the with statement replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand. More importantly, it ensures closing resources right after processing them. A common example of using the with statement is reading or writing to a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "> Multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "> It helps debug errors easily.\n",
        "> It's more perceptive than traceback methods.\n",
        "> It can be used to save info on warnings, errors and other events.\n",
        "> Logs can analyze the history of the program and provide insights, patterns and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "> Python memory management is the process of allocating and dealing with memory so that your programs can run efficiently. One advantage of Python, compared to other programming languages, is that it can perform memory management tasks automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "> In Python, exceptions are caught and handled using the 'try' and 'except' block. 'try' contains the code segment which is susceptible to error, while 'except' is where the program should jump in case an exception occurs. You can use multiple 'except' blocks for handling different types of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "> Even when the requested memory is used exclusively for internal, highly specific purposes, delegating all memory requests to the Python memory manager causes the interpreter to have a more accurate image of its memory footprint as a whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "> The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error. The else block lets you execute code when there is no error. The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "> It works by tracing the execution of a program and identifying live objects based on their accessibility from root references. Generational Garbage Collection divides objects into different generations based on their age, with the assumption that most objects become garbage relatively quickly after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "> The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error. The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "> There are five built-in levels of the log message.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Debug: These are used to give Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "    \n",
        "Info: These are used to confirm that things are working as expected\n",
        "\n",
        "Warning: These are used as an indication that something unexpected happened, or is indicative of some problem in the near future\n",
        "\n",
        "Error: This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function\n",
        "\n",
        "Critical: This tells serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "> Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently. Fork: creates a copy from the existing process (resources used or altered by a parent will be referred by the child)\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "> Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "> Read method reads the whole file as a single string while readlines segregates each of the line in the file and you then can later on call them line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "> Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running. You can use logging to record information about errors, warnings, and other events that occur during program execution. And logging is a useful tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "> This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open() , if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput module.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        ">  The basic problem in managing memory is knowing when to keep the data it contains, and when to throw it away so that the memory can be reused. This sounds easy, but is, in fact, such a hard problem that it is an entire field of study in its own right.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "> To manually raise an exception in Python, use the raise statement. Here is an example of how to use it: Copied! In this example, the calculate_payment function raises a ValueError exception if the payment_type is not either \"Visa\" or \"Mastercard\".\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "> Applications that take advantage of multithreading have numerous benefits, including the following: More efficient CPU use. Better system reliability. Improved performance on multiprocessor computers.\n",
